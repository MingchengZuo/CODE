# CODE
CODE is an advanced DE variant for optimizing the interplanetary transfer trajectory

CODE_result.rar provides the test results for K1 and K2 in this DE variant named CODE.

CODE_result_new.rar provides the test data of conducting CODE and CMA-ES together. The function evaluations for Cassini1 and Sagas are 150000, and the corresponding initial population size is 546. CMA-ES algorithm is not needed for these two problems.

For other problems, the function evaluations of CODE are 180000, and the initial population size is 700. 

----------------Employment of CMA-ES--------------

For the Messenger (reduced) problem, the function evaluations of CMA-ES is 400000; for other problems, the function evalautions are 200000.
